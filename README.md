Caesar Encryption in java Programming Language

It is a java application prepared using Caesar Cipher, the first known encryption algorithm in history.


Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia

The first cryptological ideas in history are called transposition and substitution cipher in English, that is, substitution and substitution cipher. The first of these methods is obtained by changing the places of the letters in a text, and the second is obtained by replacing the letters with other letters. Perhaps the most famous technique using this encryption is the Caesar Cipher: In this cipher, each letter is written using several letters after that letter. For example, in the 3-letter Caesar Cipher, "ghqhph" is written instead of "trial".

On the other hand, cracking the Caesar Cipher (Cyclic alphabet) is relatively easy: a philologist can find the most common letters in a language. By comparing those letters with the letters used most frequently in the message, they can find which letter has been replaced with which letter. After these steps, the message will be resolved. About the Caesar Cipher:

It is easily solved with a brute-force attack. Because the Encryption/Decryption method is not secret. Only 25 (number of letters of the Latin alphabet) different attempts are sufficient. (The key space has 25 elements.) Plaintext and its format are not hidden. A total of 26 in letter replacement encryptions! There are different password tables.
